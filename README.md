# User-Interface-Website
This repository contains the user interface (UI) for a university website project, developed as part of my coursework. The project showcases a responsive and accessible design, focusing on usability and clean layout. It was graded a 2:1, demonstrating strong implementation of front-end development principles using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
