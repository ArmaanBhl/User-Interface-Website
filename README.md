# User-Interface-Website
This repository contains the full user interface (UI) of a website I developed as part of my 2nd year university coursework, which earned a 2:1 grade. The project focused on creating a visually appealing, user-friendly, and responsive web interface for a weekend planning site using modern front-end technologies including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Key design principles such as accessibility, consistency, and intuitive navigation were applied throughout the development process. The website was designed with a clear layout and interactive features. This project reflects my growing skills in front-end development and UI design, and serves as a strong foundation for future work in web development and UI/UX Design.
